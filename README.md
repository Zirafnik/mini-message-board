# Mini Message Board

This is a simple Express app, with EJS as the view engine. I have not used a database for this project, merely an array to which the new posts get addded.

The homepage displays the posts, with most recent ones on top. You can create a new post by clicking the button on the bottom, which redirects to '/new' page.

I hosted the whole thing on Heroku.

Instructions:
1. `git clone` the repo
2. `npm install` all dependencies
3. `npm start` to start the app in production OR `npm run dev` for development
